SparseProp: Temporal Proposals for Activity Detection.

This project hosts code for the framework introduced in the paper: **[Fast Temporal Activity Proposals for Efficient Detection of Human Actions in Untrimmed Videos](http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Heilbron_Fast_Temporal_Activity_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf)**

The paper introduces a new method that produces temporal proposals in untrimmed videos. The method is not only able to retrieve temporal locations of actions with high recall but also it generates proposals quickly.

# What to know before starting to use SparseProp?
* **Dependencies:** SparseProp is implemented in [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/) including some third party packages: [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), [Scikit Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/), [H5py](http://www.h5py.org/), [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), [SPArse Modeling Software](http://spams-devel.gforge.inria.fr/), [Joblib](https://pythonhosted.org/joblib/).

* **Installation:** If you installed all the dependencies correctly, simply clone this repository to install SparseProp: ```git clone https://github.com/cabaf/sparseprop.git```

* **Feature Extraction:** The feature extraction module is not included in this code. The current version of SparseProp supports only [C3D](http://vlg.cs.dartmouth.edu/c3d/) as video representation.

# What SparseProp provides?
* **[Pre-trained model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cabaf/sparseprop/master/data/class_induced_thumos14.pkl):** Class-Induced model trained using videos from Thumos14 validation subset. Videos are represented using [C3D](http://vlg.cs.dartmouth.edu/c3d/) features.

* **[Pre-computed action proposals](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9WpeMTDrC3fdWJjajhuODZXS3c):** The resulting temporal action proposals in the Thumos14 test set.

* **Code for retrieving proposals in new videos:** Use the script ```retrieve_proposals.py``` to retrieve temporal segments in new videos. You will need to extract the C3D features by your own (Please read the ```sparseprop.feature``` for guidelines on how to format the C3D features.). 

* **Code for training a new model:** Use the script ```run_train.py``` to train a model using a new dataset (or features). For further information, please read the documentation in the script.

# Try our demo!
SparseProp provides a demo that takes as input C3D features from a sample video and a Class-Induced pre-trained model to retrieve temporal segments that are likely to contain human actions. To try our demo, run the following command:

```python retrieve_proposals.py data/demo_input.csv data/demo_c3d.hdf5 data/class_induced_thumos14.pkl data/demo_proposals.csv```

The program above must generate a CSV (data/demo_proposals.csv) file containing the temporal proposals retrieved with an asociated score for each.

**Windows users**: Please be aware of [this issue](https://github.com/cabaf/sparseprop/issues/3)
